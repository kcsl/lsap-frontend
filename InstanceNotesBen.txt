23664+23+/linux-3.19-rc1/drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/iwch_qp.c :

same for 3.17, 3.18. 
in 3.19 the order order of nodes changes in a way that dosen't matter (swapped unlock and lock at same height in graph)

[13603+39+/linux-3.19-rc1/drivers/isdn/divert/isdn_divert.c]

same as above, this time the cfg changes node order, but no functional difference between them

[19691+30+/linux-3.19-rc1/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40evf/i40e_adminq.c]

missing cfg/efg for some reason.

the offset changed between 3.18 and 3.19, but no important difference in matching pair graph

[5961+26+/linux-3.19-rc1/drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c]

same as first two
